    <h1>Customer Profile: Maria Rodriguez</h1>
    
    <p>Maria Rodriguez (Customer ID: C0002) has been a valued client of Pacific Coast Bank since June 2019. A Los Angeles resident, Maria is 45 years old and works as a marketing manager for a regional healthcare company, earning an annual income of $78,000. Her conservative investment approach reflects her focus on preserving capital while generating steady, reliable returns.</p>
    
    <p>Maria maintains both a checking account for daily transactions and a substantial investment account with Pacific Coast Bank. Her investment portfolio demonstrates her risk-averse nature, heavily weighted toward blue-chip stocks like Global Finance Corp (GFIN) and established companies with consistent dividend payments. She particularly favors financial services and healthcare sector stocks, industries she understands well through her professional experience.</p>
    
    <p>Born in July 1978, Maria is entering her peak earning years and is focused on building a retirement nest egg. She contributes the maximum amount to her employer-sponsored 401(k) plan and has established a separate investment account for additional retirement savings. Her credit score of 698 is solid, though she has expressed interest in strategies to improve it further to qualify for better mortgage rates when she's ready to upgrade to a larger home.</p>
    
    <p>Maria is a single mother of two teenagers, and her financial planning priorities reflect her family responsibilities. She maintains an emergency fund covering six months of expenses and has established 529 college savings plans for both children. Her transaction history shows regular, disciplined savings patterns, with automated monthly transfers to various savings and investment accounts.</p>
    
    <p>Financial advisors note that Maria is highly engaged with her finances, regularly attending the bank's financial literacy workshops. She has expressed particular interest in learning more about estate planning, life insurance options, and tax-efficient investment strategies. Maria prefers in-person meetings for major financial decisions but uses online banking for routine transactions and account monitoring.</p>
    
    <p>Recent conversations with Maria's financial advisor reveal her interest in socially responsible investing. She has inquired about ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) funds and companies with strong sustainability practices. The bank is working with her to gradually shift a portion of her portfolio toward investments that align with her values while maintaining her conservative risk profile.</p>
