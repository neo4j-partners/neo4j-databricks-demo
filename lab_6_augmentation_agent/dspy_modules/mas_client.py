"""
Multi-Agent Supervisor Client for Graph Augmentation Analysis.

This module queries the Multi-Agent Supervisor (MAS) endpoint from Lab 5
to perform gap analysis between structured graph data (via Genie) and
unstructured documents (via Knowledge Agent).

The MAS coordinates both agents to answer questions that span the
structured-unstructured divide, which is the core capability needed
for graph augmentation.

Key queries supported:
- Interest-holding gap analysis (customers with interests not in portfolios)
- Risk profile alignment (portfolio vs stated risk tolerance)
- Data quality gaps (profile info missing from structured data)
- Investment theme extraction (from market research documents)

Authentication is handled automatically by WorkspaceClient:
- On Databricks: Uses runtime's built-in authentication
- Locally: Uses DATABRICKS_HOST and DATABRICKS_TOKEN from .env

Analyze customer investment interests vs their actual portfolio holdings.

For each customer with profile documents:
1. What investment interests have they expressed? (renewable energy, ESG,
   technology, real estate, etc.)
2. What stocks/sectors do they currently hold in their portfolios?
3. Identify gaps where expressed interests don't match holdings.

Format your response as a detailed analysis for each customer including:
- Customer ID and name
- Expressed interests (from profile documents)
- Current holdings (from portfolio data)
- Identified gaps (interests not reflected in portfolio)
- Specific quotes from their profile showing the interest

Focus especially on:
- James Anderson (C0001) and renewable energy interest
- Maria Rodriguez (C0002) and ESG/sustainable investing interest
- Robert Chen (C0003) and technology/aggressive growth interest

Analyze risk profile alignment between customer profiles and portfolios.

For each customer:
1. What is their stated risk tolerance in the structured database?
2. What risk-related language appears in their profile documents?
3. Does their actual portfolio composition match their risk profile?

Identify customers where:
- Profile narrative suggests different risk tolerance than database field
- Portfolio composition doesn't match stated risk tolerance
- Risk preferences have evolved based on profile updates

Include specific evidence from both structured data and profile documents.
"""

DATA_QUALITY_GAP_QUERY: Final[str] = """
Identify data quality gaps between customer profiles and structured database.

Compare the information in customer profile documents against what's stored
in the structured customer database tables.

Look for:
1. Personal attributes mentioned in profiles but missing from database
   (occupation details, employer, life stage, family situation)
2. Financial goals mentioned in profiles but not captured as structured data
3. Investment preferences detailed in profiles but not in database fields
4. Contact preferences or communication style notes
5. Any temporal information (retirement timeline, education savings goals)

For each gap found, provide:
- The customer ID
- The attribute/information found in the profile
- Whether it exists in the structured database
- The exact quote or reference from the profile document

INVESTMENT_THEMES_QUERY: Final[str] = """
Extract investment themes from market research documents.

Analyze all market research, sector analysis, and investment guide documents to identify:

1. Major investment themes being discussed
   - Theme name (e.g., "Renewable Energy Transition", "AI Infrastructure")
   - Market size and growth projections mentioned
   - Key sectors within the theme
   - Specific companies mentioned as opportunities

2. Sector-specific insights
   - Technology sector trends and key players
   - Renewable energy opportunities and companies
   - Financial sector analysis
   - Any emerging sectors discussed

3. Risk considerations mentioned
   - Valuation concerns
   - Market timing considerations
   - Sector-specific risks

For each theme, include the source document and relevant quotes.

Perform comprehensive gap analysis for graph augmentation opportunities.

This analysis will identify information in documents that should be captured

PART 1: Customer Interest-Holding Gaps
For each customer (James Anderson, Maria Rodriguez, Robert Chen):
- What investment interests are expressed in their profiles?
- What do they currently hold in their portfolios?
- What's the gap between interests and holdings?
- Quote the specific profile text showing their interests.

PART 2: Missing Entity Relationships
What relationships are implied in documents but not in the graph?
- Customer-to-interest relationships (INTERESTED_IN)
- Customer-to-goal relationships (HAS_GOAL)
- Customer-to-employer relationships (WORKS_AT)
- Customer similarity patterns (SIMILAR_TO)

PART 3: Missing Customer Attributes
What customer attributes appear in profiles but aren't in structured data?
- Occupation and employer details
- Life stage (mid-career, approaching retirement, etc.)
- Investment philosophy
- Communication preferences

PART 4: Investment Theme Entities
What investment themes from research should become graph nodes?
- Theme names and descriptions
- Associated sectors and companies
- Market size and growth data

Provide specific evidence and quotes for each finding.
