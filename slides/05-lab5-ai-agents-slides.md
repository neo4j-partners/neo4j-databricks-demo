# Lab 5: Create AI Agents
## Natural Language to Data

---

## Concepts Introduced

**AI Agents** - LLM-powered systems that use tools to answer questions and take actions.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Genie** - Databricks' natural language to SQL agent for structured data
- **Knowledge Agent** - RAG-based agent that retrieves from document collections
- **Text-to-SQL** - LLM generates SQL from natural language questions
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** - Retrieve relevant documents, then generate answers

**The Structured vs Unstructured Gap:**
- Structured data: What customers *have* (accounts, positions, transactions)
- Unstructured data: What customers *want* (interests, goals, preferences)

---

## Two Agent Types

| Agent | Data Type | Capability |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Genie** | Structured (Delta tables) | SQL generation from natural language |
| **Knowledge Agent** | Unstructured (HTML docs) | Document retrieval and analysis |

**The Gap:** Customers have stated interests in documents that aren't reflected in their portfolio data.

## Genie Agent (Structured Data)

Queries the **14 Delta tables** we exported from Neo4j.

**Sample Questions:**
```
"Show me customers with investment accounts and their portfolio values"
"What are the top 10 customers by account balance?"
"Which customers have high risk profiles but conservative portfolios?"
```

**Configuration:**
- Define measures (Total Portfolio Value, Account Balance)
- Define filters (High Value Accounts, Recent Transactions)
- Add column descriptions and synonyms

---

## Knowledge Agent (Unstructured Data)

Analyzes **HTML documents** in Unity Catalog Volumes.

**Content Indexed:**
- Customer profiles with investment preferences
- Bank and institutional profiles
- Company research and quarterly reports
- Market analysis and investment guides

**Sample Questions:**
```
"What investment interests does James Anderson have?"
"What renewable energy opportunities are in the research documents?"
```

**Next:** Combine both agents into a unified system
